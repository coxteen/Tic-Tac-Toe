# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is the source code for a simple tic tac toe game that i made using Godot Engine.

In this game i learned about simple game mechanics and Godot features : 
 - win, lose and draw condition
 - mouse interaction
 - working with nodes and scenes (adding or removing childs form the scene)
 - signals
 - composition
